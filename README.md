# SpaceGame
Game created on a console application where you travel to different planets, buying and selling goods, to save your planet

Hello my name is Noe Rivera Jr. My group and I were tasked to create a "Space Game" where you travel to different planets, buying and selling goods, to save your planet. The project was for us to get used to working in an Agile software development environment, and to collabrate as a team, as it was the first time many of us utilized GitHub. It was a great experience to be able to create something tangible that we created together. I will continue to update the game in my spare time to continue to practice all that I have learned.
